* Yet another patch panel
** Because the ones I want to use
   aren't available for vanilla ubuntu
** Because the ones that are available
   for vanilla ubuntu are useless.
* Basics
** Manage Jack and Pulse clients and connections
** Start programs or components with a PATH lookup
   or with explicit paths to executables
** Notice their available ports
** Notice any auto connections they do
** Assume that auto connections to system sources
   and sinks are hints about where the inputs and
   outputs of the program/component should be.
** Allow the connections to be memoized
** Draw nice boxes with splined wires connecting
   outputs to inputs.
** Allow the programs to rewire, mark a connection as volatile
* Pajaro
